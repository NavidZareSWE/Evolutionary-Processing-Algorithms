All Corrections for the GP Maze Solver Assignment
1. MOVES in Leaf Nodes (NOT Conditions)

PDF said: Conditions should be in leaf nodes
Correction: MOVES (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) must be in LEAF nodes
Structure: Internal nodes = conditions (IF_WALL_UP, IF_GOAL_DOWN, etc.), Leaf nodes = actions


2. Walls Don't Block Movement

PDF implied: Walls block movement (traditional maze)
Correction: Agent CAN move through walls, but receives a penalty
Key point: "Wall" is a misnomer — it's a penalty cell, not a blocking wall
Agent can always move in all 4 directions (except at maze boundaries)


3. No Explicit Wall Blocking

Wrong approach: Using if/else to prevent agent from entering walls
Correction: Never explicitly tell the algorithm it can't go through walls
The algorithm must learn to avoid walls through evolution (fitness pressure)


4. Fitness Formula ALWAYS Applies

PDF implied: F = 0 when goal is reached
Correction: The formula F = s + 2d + 10w + 5l always applies
When goal reached: d=0, so F = s + 10w + 5l
F = 0 only when: optimal steps + 0 wall hits + 0 loops
Goal is to find the best/optimal path, not just any path


5. Remove IF_VISITED_ Functions*

Not needed: IF_VISITED_UP, IF_VISITED_DOWN, IF_VISITED_LEFT, IF_VISITED_RIGHT
Why: Loops are allowed, but penalized in fitness (5 × revisits)
Survivor selection naturally eliminates looping solutions (worse fitness = lower survival chance)


6. Don't Find Solution in Generation 0

Constraint: Initial population should NOT contain the optimal solution
Why: Evolution must actually work to find the solution
Fix: Reject initial trees with fitness below a threshold (e.g., < 25)
