# Evolutionary Processing Algorithms

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of materials from the "Evolutionary Processing" course, which delves into evolutionary algorithms including Genetic Algorithms (GA). It includes code implementations, assignments, and project examples demonstrating how these algorithms mimic natural evolution to solve complex optimization problems.

## Contents
- **Implementations**: Python scripts for core GA components like population initialization, selection methods (e.g., roulette wheel, tournament), crossover (single-point, uniform), and mutation.
- **Examples**: Case studies on applications such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), function optimization, and neural network evolution.
- **Projects**: Hands-on assignments and final projects exploring hybrid algorithms or real-world adaptations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Evolutionary-Processing-Algorithms.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable, e.g., numpy, matplotlib for visualizations).
3. Run examples: Navigate to the `examples/` directory and execute scripts like `python ga_tsp.py`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of programming and algorithms
